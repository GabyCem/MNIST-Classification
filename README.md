# Speech-Command-Classifier

In this project we will train a model that will classify the type a number given images of it (MNIST).
The dataset contains grayscale images of 10 handwritten digits 0-9.


Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with
it.

The obhective is to train a multi-class neural network with the MNIST dataset. The network uses one hidden layer
with the Sigmoid activation function.

The model minimizes the Negative Log Likelihood (The loss function in multi-class classification).
